# TND004 - Data Structures Labs
These are lab assignments completed as part of the course TND004 – Data Structures at Linköping University.
This repository contains a series of hands-on programming tasks designed to deepen the understanding of 
fundamental data structures and their applications. 

## 📁 Structure
Each lab has its own directory and they contain:

- main.cpp – Starter or driver code.

- *.h / *.cpp – Implementation files for data structures and algorithms.

- text files (for testing).

## 🔧 Requirements
- C++17 or later

- A C++ compiler (e.g., g++, clang++)

- CMake (optional, for building larger projects)

## 📚 Topics Covered
The labs cover key data structure concepts including:

- Linked Lists

- Stacks & Queues

- Trees (BST, AVL)

- Hash Tables

- Graphs

- Sorting & Searching Algorithms

- Complexity Analysis
