# TND004 - Data Structures Labs
Welcome to the lab assignments for TND004 - Data Structures. This repository contains a series of hands-on
programming tasks designed to deepen your understanding of fundamental data structures and their applications.

## 📁 Structure
Each lab has it´s own directory and they contain:

- main.cpp – Starter or driver code.

- *.h / *.cpp – Implementation files for data structures and algorithms.

- text files (for testing).

## 🔧 Requirements
- C++17 or later

- A C++ compiler (e.g., g++, clang++)

- CMake (optional, for building larger projects)

##📚 Topics Covered
The labs cover key data structure concepts including:

- Linked Lists

- Stacks & Queues

- Trees (BST, AVL)

- Hash Tables

- Graphs

- Sorting & Searching Algorithms

- Complexity Analysis
